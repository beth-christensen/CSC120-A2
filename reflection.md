I had a lot of trouble understanding how the reale shop was acessing the Computer class when it wasn't in 
the same file. Jordan's explanation that Computer was a local library that we were calling elements of 
was really helpful. I think that there was a lot of confusion around using "ItemID" as well. It turns out we didn't need it at all but I was told that I did and then that was also confusing. Things became a lot more clear once Jordan explained that we don't need the itemID anymore because each computer now has its individual attributes that are unique, rendering and Item ID redundant.
